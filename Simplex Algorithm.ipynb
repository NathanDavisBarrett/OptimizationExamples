    "\n",
    "Remember that the gist of the simplex algorithm is that an optimal solution to an LP will lie at a vertex of two or more constraints. The trick is to find which vertex is the optimal solution. For any randomly selected vertex we could check if we have the optimal solution by checking each neighboring vertex and comparing objective function values. If we found a neighboring vertex with a more optimal objective function value, then we try again on that vertex. If, by chance we picked the optimal vertex right off the bat, we could prove that we have the optimal solution relatively quickly. But if we already knew the optimal solution, we wouldn't need the Simplex algorithm in the first place. So, instead we select a random vertex and iterate from there until we find the optimal vertex.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mathematically, we define a vertex as a series of active inequality constraints. In standard form, an active inequality constraint simply means that a respective variable is set to zero. In other words, selecting the appropriate active constraints is mathematically equivalent to setting appropriate variables to zero and solving the linear equation to find the values of the remaining variables. We call the remaining variables a \"Basis\" and the zero-values variables \"Basic Variables\".\n",

    "\n",
    "Technically, you could pick any algorithm to swap variables into and out of the basis: So long as the condition in step 2 is satisfied, you can arrive at the optimal solution. But randomly moving variables around is not likely to get you to the optimal solution in a reasonable amount of time. Here, I'll present some common heuristics (rules of thumb) for determining which variables to move in and out. Profesional solvers are exceptionally good at knowing which variables to move in and out; that is why they're so fast.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 3-a: Select which variable to move from B to N\n",
    "Since we want our reduced costs to be less than or equal to zero, a good choice to eliminate is the variable whose associated reduced cost is the highest.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our example, the highest reduced cost value is $4$ which corresponds to $s_1$ in $\\vec{x}_B$. So we'll select $s_1$ to move from B to N.\n",

    "#### Step 3-b: Select which variable to move from N to B\n",
    "Determining which incoming variable will produce the lowest reduced cost is a little more tricky and mathematically involved. But the gist is that you want to select the variable $i$ with the lowest positive value of $\\frac{\\left( \\vec{\\vec{B}}^{-1} \\vec{b} \\right)_i}{\\left( \\vec{\\vec{B}}^{-1} \\vec{\\vec{N}} \\right)_{i,j}}$ where $j$ is the variable selected in step 3-a.\n",
